# Unicafe
### By: TJ Hooker

- Collects customer feeback via button clicks.
- Keeps track of three different types of feedback: good, neutral, bad. 
- Calculates the average feeback 
- Calculates the percentage of positive reviews

*Note* - *App was created for the fullstackopen.com exercise. However, I took liberties with the requirements and separated all components into separate modules.*
